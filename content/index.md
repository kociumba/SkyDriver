title: Welcome to the SkyDriver docs
---

I made these docs to document [config options](Config) in the `~/.skydriver/config.toml` file.
But now that this exists I might as well make it a full doc of the app.

> [!WARNING]
> These docs are not going to be fully finished for a while and for now the [readme](https://github.com/kociumba/SkyDriver/blob/main/README.md) is still the best way to learn the app.

For information on how to use and configure SkyDriver, follow the #user-guide tag. Every other type of info also has it's own tag: #config for anything related to configuration, #internals for anything that won't be interesting to someone who just wants to use SkyDriver.
